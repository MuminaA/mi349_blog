                PlayStation Plus subscribers will be swimming in free games next month, as the normal number is getting doubled. <br />
                To celebrate the PSVR's fifth birthday, PlayStation has announced that it will give away a trio of PlayStation <br />
                VR games to PS Plus members in November. These freebies will be in addition to the regular monthly lineup--which <br />
                typically includes a PS5 game and two PS4 games--so subscribers will get six free games total. PlayStation hasn't <br />
                revealed which PSVR games will be free, but we imagine they will be notable titles given the occasion. The peripheral <br />
                has built up quite the library.<br />

            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps the freebies will hail from the list of "most played games" PlayStation shared. Rec Room, Beat Saber, <br />
                PlayStation VR Worlds, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR, and Resident Evil 7 (which is playable outside of VR, too) <br />
                have earned the distinction as the most popular PSVR games by playtime.<br />
                You should claim next month's free PSVR games even if you don't currently have the virtual reality headset. <br />
                That way if you ever decide to get one--or the next-gen model that Sony is currently developing--you'll already <br />
                have some games to play. For more suggestions to fill out your PSVR library, check out our roundup of the best PSVR games.<br />

            <h3><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/twitch-in-crisis-as-it-blames-server-error-for-massive-data-breach/">Twitch in crisis as it blames server error for massive data breach</a></h3>
            <h4>By Rich Stanton </h4>

            <p><img src="TwitchNews.png" width="500" height="400" alt="Twitch"></p>

            <p>
                The Twitch hack is real, it's massive, and security experts are aghast at the scale of the thing: <br />
                "this is as bad as it could possibly be." The leak, which the hackers claim is only "part one," <br />
                contains the site's source code, unannounced projects such as a Steam competitor, and the earnings of streamers.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                Yesterday Twitch issued what was very much a holding statement, and has now expanded upon what it believes happened. <br />
                Per the Twitch blog:<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                "We have learned that some data was exposed to the internet due to an error in a Twitch server configuration change <br />
                that was subsequently accessed by a malicious third party. Our teams are working with urgency to investigate the incident.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                "As the investigation is ongoing, we are still in the process of understanding the impact in detail. We understand that <br />
                this situation raises concerns, and we want to address some of those here while our investigation continues."<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                That is, Twitch is putting this down to the human element: someone set up the company's servers incorrectly, and the <br />
                hackers were able to find and access it. Whether this is human error or something more nefarious is unknown for now.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                And the other thing this statement makes clear is that Twitch itself is still trying to understand just how bad this is.<br />
